# Vriti Dahiya | Computer Science Specialist @ University of Toronto

### Professional Summary
My work focuses on building end-to-end data systems that connect **Generative AI** and **algorithmic decision-making**. I apply techniques across scalable **fintech infrastructure**, **risk modeling**, and **automated reasoning** to solve the "black-box" problem. I am particularly interested in the formal challenges of **Sequential Decision Optimization** and designing **Interactive Recommender Systems** that minimize uncertainty in high-stakes environments.
